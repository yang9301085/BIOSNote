Abuse of tariff measures likely to backfire

The United States' new tariff push is likely to backfire by accelerating the de-dollarization trend and potentially prompting sell-offs of US Treasuries by major foreign debt holders, leading economists and currency experts said.

"With the abuse of tariff measures, the US is changing itself from a 'maker and defender' of international rules to a 'destroyer and coercer'," Zhao Zhongxiu, president of the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing, said in an exclusive interview with China Daily.

The US' "reciprocal tariffs", which were announced on Wednesday and include a 10 percent "minimum baseline tariff" and higher rates on certain trading partners, are expected to deal a heavy blow to the multilateral trade system and global commercial practices, while leading to greater economic isolation of the US. All of this will erode US credibility, further dampen the world's confidence in the dollar and push more countries to settle trade in alternative currencies, said Zhao.

Furthermore, some trade partners of the US may see reduced dollar income as exports to the US drop, and they may have to sell US Treasuries to obtain the dollar liquidity needed for international payments, Zhao said. For China, selling US Treasuries could even be considered a possible countermeasure, if necessary, he added.

The Chinese government will continue to take resolute measures to safeguard its sovereignty, security and development interests, according to a statement released by Xinhua News Agency on Saturday on China's position on opposing US abuse of tariffs.

"We don't make trouble, but we have no fear of trouble," the statement said, adding that the US tariff push is sacrificing the legitimate interests of countries worldwide to serve the US' own hegemonic agenda.

As severe turbulence is set to unfold in global trade, the UIBE president said that China's commitment to fostering a more open, stable market environment and creating more opportunities for mutual benefit will be crucial in avoiding a drastic global economic recession.

Following the US tariff announcement, Stephane Dujarric, spokesman for the secretary-general of the United Nations, expressed concern over the "rise in economic protectionism" and its impact on the global economy.

Guan Tao, global chief economist at investment bank BOCI China, told China Daily that the "reciprocal tariffs" may increase the risk of a deep global recession, drawing parallels to the 1930 Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, which triggered retaliatory measures, collapsed global trade and deepened the Great Depression.

特朗普的“对等关税”意味着什么？

滥用关税，适得其反

权威经济学家和货币专家表示，美国新的关税举措可能会事与愿违，反而会加速国际去美元化趋势，并促使主要美债持有者抛售美国国债。

北京对外经济贸易大学校长赵忠秀在接受《中国日报》专访时表示：“滥用关税措施，让美国正从国际规则的‘制定者和维护者’变成‘破坏者和胁迫者’。”

美国于周三（4月2日）宣布的“对等关税”其中包括10%的“最低基准关税”以及对某些贸易伙伴征收更高关税，预计将对多边贸易规则体系和全球商业实践带来巨大冲击，同时将使美国成为一个愈发自我封闭的经济体。赵校长表示，这些都将削弱美国的信誉，进一步削弱世界对美元的信心，也将促使各国在国际贸易结算中加速使用其他货币来替代美元作为国际结算货币。

赵校长表示，除此之外，随着对美出口下降，美国的一些贸易伙伴会面临美元收入减少的问题，他们可能不得不抛售美国国债以获取美元流动性，满足国际支付结算的需要。他还补充道，对于中国来说，在必要时出售美国国债甚至可以被视为一种可采取的反制措施。

新华社周六（4月5日）发表的关于中国政府反对美国滥施关税的立场声明称，中国已经并将继续采取坚决措施，维护自身主权、安全和发展利益。

声明称：“我们不惹事，也不怕事，”并补充表示，美国的关税举措是在牺牲全世界各国的正当利益服务美国的霸权利益。

对外经济贸易大学校长表示，随着全球贸易将迎来剧烈动荡，中国要致力于营造更加开放稳定的市场环境，创造更多互利共赢的机遇，这对于避免全球经济陷入严重衰退至关重要。

在美国宣布新关税政策后，联合国秘书长发言人斯特凡纳·迪雅里克（Stephane Dujarric）对“经济保护主义抬头”及其对全球经济的影响表示担忧。

中银国际证券全球首席经济学家管涛对《中国日报》称，美“对等关税”可能会加剧全球衰退的风险，与1930年的《斯姆特-霍利关税法案》相似。当时该法案引发了报复性的全球贸易战，致使全球贸易崩溃，并加剧了大萧条的影响。
