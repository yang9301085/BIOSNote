# Colonialism：Proof in the pudding 
## The joys of British-American food
<P>Pilsen, a gentrifying neighbourhood on the South West Side of Chicago, is a regular spot for visitors hoping to eat interesting food. Until it was cancelled this year, the local mole festival, held each spring, drew hundreds of Mexican food fans (a mole is a sort of thick sauce). Chinese and Vietnamese restaurants have spilled over from nearby Chinatown. Another excellent place to eat is the Pleasant House Pub. At this spot patrons can order starters of Scotch eggs (pictured, below), Welsh rarebit, curry on chips or chicken balti pie. Dessert includes sticky toffee pudding. To wash it down there is a cask ale, brewed locally.</P> <P>The Pleasant House, which opened in 2011 as a pie shop, was founded by Arthur Jackson, the American-born son of a Yorkshire bricklayer. Mr Jackson, a chef, says he and his wife, Chelsea, hadn’t originally planned on making much of his British heritage. But wanting to offer something original, he realised that he had never seen a British-style savoury pie on offer in America.Panda Foreign Magazine Intensive Reading:Respect for Originality, Piracy Must Be Punished</P> <P>As recently as 2018, a writer in the New York Times felt able to make a joke about British food being largely “porridge and boiled mutton”. Yet opinions have shifted so much that Americans are seeking out British food. Chicago has a clutch of British-style gastropubs. At the Armitage Alehouse, diners are promised a “London, circa 1926” vibe. At the Red Lion Pub the shelves “are lined with books about British history and literature” and the menu includes a full English breakfast.</P> <P>Though less visible than their Irish equivalents, British pubs have been around for a while. Minneapolis has had Brit’s Pub for 30 years. Des Moines has the Royal Mile. In the past such places mostly served the same sort of food as American bars—burgers, nachos and perhaps a bad shepherd’s pie. Elephant and Castle, a chain of British-themed pubs that serves inauthentic stuff like Big Ben Brownies and shows soccer matches, is typical. The Britishness is in the decor, not on the plate. But that is changing.Panda Foreign Magazine Intensive Reading:Respect for Originality, Piracy Must Be Punished</P> <P>British restaurant chains are opening in America. Last year, Hawksmoor, a London steakhouse, opened a branch in Chicago, having started a few years earlier in New York. For a Brit to sell steaks to Chicagoans is brave, admits Huw Gott, the firm’s founder. And yet it seems to be working. A particular success is the Sunday roast, which Hawksmoor advertises as being like “a weekly Thanksgiving meal”. British Asian food is also thriving. In August, Dishoom, a fancy London chain inspired by Bombay’s Parsi cafes, is opening a pop-up in New York. And as beer drinkers turn away from overly strong IPAs, long-derided British ales, with their lower alcohol content, are becoming fashionable.</P> <P>What explains this rush of Anglophilia?Is it television? Or travel? Mr Gott has a novel theory: that the food is good. He searched for weeks to find an American farm with suitable grass-fed cows. The gastropub model of restaurant, serving traditional cooking with high-quality ingredients, was brought to America by April Bloomfield at“The Spotted Pig"in New York 20 years ago. Though it closed in 2020, it inspired competitors. Perhaps British food is popular because it is just better now. That's what our sauces say.</P>
