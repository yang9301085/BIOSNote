Students ditch libraries for fun, focus of theme parks

Scholars find serenity, relief amid roller coaster rides, parades

An unexpected trend is sweeping China as students flock to Disneyland, Universal Studios and other theme parks not for the thrill of the rides, parades or fairytale magic, but to find relaxing places to study.

Li Xishan, a PhD student at Beijing Medical University, spends most of her days buried in textbooks, research papers, and preparing for tough exams. The pressure is relentless, and the long hours in the library often leave her exhausted and mentally drained, she said. "If I'm going to spend hours studying, why not do it somewhere more exciting?" said Li, who has an annual pass to Universal Studios Beijing. She quickly calculated that if she visited at least three times a year, the cost would be justified.

Xu Han, a 28-year-old remote worker in Shanghai, has taken this idea even further — making Disneyland her weekly workspace. With the freedom to choose where she works, Xu, an avid Disney fan, realized that the happiest place on earth could also be the most productive. The vast green lawns of Disneyland, she says, are an ideal workspace — open, often sunlit, and filled with cheerful background music. She tackles her tasks with a sense of lightness that a conventional office could never provide.

Compromise solution

The phenomenon of studying in unconventional places reflects the difficult situation faced by contemporary youth who are torn between the pressure to succeed and the desire for joy. In a Chinese-style education system where "playing recklessly" is seen as a luxury, young people struggle with a paradox: indulging too much feels irresponsible, yet traditional learning feels suffocating. By choosing to study in a theme park, they seek a compromise — a way to balance academic expectations with entertainment.

"Choosing to study in the most chaotic environment while engaging in the most focused activity is an act of defiance against orthodox norms. Yet, like any adventure fraught with risks, this unconventional learning method may ultimately prove unsustainable," said Yu Hai, a sociology professor at Fudan University. Yu added that the initial sense of freedom may eventually give way to guilt as academic pressures mount, revealing that, despite their attempts to break free, young people remain tethered to the very expectations they seek to escape.

"Studying at joyful places like Disneyland is more than just an experiment in efficiency — it is an unintentional act of rebellion, a search for new possibilities in a world that so often presents only rigid choices," said Yu.
