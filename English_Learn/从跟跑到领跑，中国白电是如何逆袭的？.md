White goods exports log robust growth

Policy support, growing foothold in emerging markets boost performance

In a strong demonstration of resilience and innovation, China's home appliance sector delivered a stellar export performance in 2024, with export value surpassing the $100 billion threshold for a fourth consecutive year, the latest report by an industry association showed.

According to the 2024 China Home Appliance (White Goods) Export Annual Report released by the China Chamber of Commerce for Import and Export of Machinery and Electronic Products (CCCME), the sector's export value for white goods — a category encompassing major household appliances — recorded a remarkable $128.64 billion, up 14.8 percent year-on-year, solidifying the nation's position as a global powerhouse in the industry.

The stable growth momentum is largely attributed to China's robust policy support for promoting stable foreign trade growth, the country's growing foothold in emerging markets, the recovery seen in European and North American markets, and the accelerated global expansion of Chinese home appliance brands, said Zhou Nan, secretary-general of the CCCME's home appliances branch.

"The growth did not come easily," said Zhou, adding that in the face of a complex international environment and the rising tide of trade protectionism, China's home appliance manufacturers upheld a globalized path, finding a way out and strengthening their competitiveness through independent innovation, brand building and overseas supply chain construction.

Zhou said the industry has transformed from being a manufacturer of products designed by foreign clients to becoming a leader in design, innovation and production. In terms of  overseas market performance, the CCCME report revealed significant growth in exports to emerging markets involved in the Belt and Road Initiative, particularly in Latin America, the Middle East and ASEAN member states.

One of the key factors behind this growth is China's ability to swiftly adapt to shifting global demand trends, Zhou said. From the "stay-at-home economy" driving surges in demand for kitchen appliances and refrigeration equipment during the COVID-19 pandemic, to the European energy crisis fueling the need for heating devices, and the global warming trend propelling air conditioning demand, China's home appliance sector has been quick to introduce products that cater to evolving needs, consolidating its competitive edge worldwide, he said.

Moreover, amid global uncertainties, Chinese home appliance companies are also ramping up efforts to strengthen their supply chain resilience, setting up production facilities and making strategic investments in overseas destinations such as Southeast Asia and the Middle East, Zhou added.
