“全球AI电影马拉松大赛”启动，你想参加吗？

AI film marathon competition kicks off in Los Angeles

“全球AI电影马拉松大赛”在洛杉矶启动

Just one month after the premiere of the world's first AI feature film in Los Angeles, film and television companies are accelerating the integration of artificial intelligence technology into the industry.

距离全球首部AI长篇电影洛杉矶首映礼仅1个月后，全球影视企业加紧推进AI技术在影视产业链中的应用落地。

Shanghai Film Company took its init iative abroad and hosted an event titled "The New Era: AI & Global Film" on Monday in Los Angeles, displaying the robust presence of Chinese films and television in the IP+AI domain to international audiences. The event marked the official launch of the Global AI Film Marathon competition, which aims to discover high-quality AI film and television startups, projects and talent worldwide. Seeking to establish a global "AI+film" ecosystem, the competition offers a prize pool of $100,000, with investment opportunities of up to 1 billion yuan ($140 million) from the Shanghai Film New Vision Fund.

北京时间4月9日，上海电影走出国门，在洛杉矶举办“畅想未来：全球AI电影时代”发布会，首次面向海外展现中国影视在IP+AI领域的强劲布局势头，正式开启“全球AI电影马拉松大赛”的报名通道。大赛旨在全球范围内发掘优质AI影视创投项目，招募全球“AI+”影视方向顶尖人才。为建设全球影视产业AI合作生态，大赛设立10万美金奖金池，以及总额高达10亿人民币（约合1.4亿美元）的上影新视野基金潜在投资合作机会。

Earlier this year, the threat of AI to Hollywood's status quo became more tangible with the introduction of Sora by OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT. Sora is a tool capable of generating photorealistic and cinematic video from text-based prompts, further highlighting the potential of AI in filmmaking.

今年年初，OpenAI（也是推出ChatGPT的公司）推出了Sora，这让AI对好莱坞现状的威胁变得更加明显。Sora是一款能够根据文本提示生成逼真且具有电影质感视频的AI工具，进一步突显了AI在电影制作中的潜力。

Last month, Los Angeles welcomed the world premiere of one of the first feature-length films entirely generated by AI. This groundbreaking parody remake of Terminator 2 involved the collaboration of 50 artists in the AI space, demonstrating the evolving landscape of AI-driven creativity in cinema.

上个月，全球首部完全由AI生成的长篇电影在洛杉矶举行了首映礼。这部由50名AI艺术家合创的《终结者2》翻拍电影，展示了AI驱动的电影创意的发展前景。

Since Sora sparked a wave of turbulence in the film and television industry, Shanghai Film has swiftly responded to the AI trends, and the Global AI Film Marathon will be a crucial platform for talent acquisition through projects and talent chain technology.

继Sora掀起影视行业震荡以来，上海电影迅速响应AI浪潮。本次“全球AI电影马拉松大赛”将作为“以项目聚人才，以人才链技术”的重要抓手之一。

Andre Morgan, co-chair of the Chinese American Film Festival and producer of the Oscar-winning film Million Dollar Baby, stressed the significant potential for AI cooperation in film co-productions between the United States and China. He emphasized Shanghai's longstanding position at the forefront of innovation in media, entertainment and technology. Morgan said he believes that through Shanghai's initiative in launching the competition, both sides can actively promote participation among young filmmakers and encourage them to take part in the endeavor.

中美电影节联合主席、奥斯卡获奖电影《百万美元宝贝》制片人安德鲁·摩根（Andre Morgan）强调了中美在电影合作制作中开展AI合作的巨大潜力。他指出，上海一直都在媒体、娱乐及技术新领域探索的最前沿，并表示此次通过上海的发起，双方可以激励更多年轻电影制作人共同参与其中。

Li Zhiqiang, deputy consul general of China's Consulate General in Los Angeles, said China and the US, as the world's two largest film markets, are highly complementary in industrial development and economic interests. "With the help of this competition, the film and television industry of China and the US can work together to leverage the advantages of artificial intelligence, carry out practical and efficient cooperation, and actively explore beneficial aspects," he said.

中国驻洛杉矶总领馆副总领事李志强指出，中美作为世界上最大的两个电影市场，无论在产业发展还是行业经济利益上都高度互补，“借助本次大赛，中美影视界可携手发挥人工智能优势，开展务实高效的合作与积极有益的探索”。
