<p>East Buy, a subsidiary of private tutoring giant New Oriental that successfully transitioned to a livestreaming e-commerce company, removed Sun Dongxu as its executive director and CEO, and named New Oriental's founder Yu Minhong as its chief executive</p>
<p>The appointment, which was confirmed by the Hong Kong Stock Exchange late on Sunday, came after a dispute involving the company's most influential livestreamer, Dong Yuhui, intensified last week, leading the Hong Kong-listed company to suffer billion-yuan losses on the stock market within days.</P>

<p>The latest dispute started after the editorial team of East Buy said on Dec 6 that the script used by Dong during livestreaming was written by the team and not by the star alone. It quickly prompted a group of online shoppers and many of Dong's fans to question the company for taking credit for his work and longtime efforts.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, Sun Dongxu, then CEO of East Buy, said in a livestream that neither the editorial team nor Dong had behaved appropriately, adding that Dong is treated well by the company and draws a steep annual salary.</p>

<p>Sun also condemned the "fandom culture", noting that netizens often attack a company because of their idol. He triggered a wave of anger among netizens with his remarks and aggressive approach during the livestream, including hurling his cellphone onto a table.</p>

<p>Many netizens said they felt offended by Sun's behavior. They said they felt like employees being rebuked by their boss, instead of being respected as consumers.</P>

<p>Later, both Sun and Yu, the founder of New Oriental, as well as Dong, apologized for the incident and clarified that the script used for the livestream was written by both the editorial team and Dong.</p>

<p>However, this didn't stop the stock price of the Beijing-based company from plunging to HK$26.25 ($3.69) per share on Friday from HK$32.75 on Dec 6. The number of followers on East Buy's Douyin account was 28 million as of Sunday, a significant drop from over 31 million a week ago.</p>

<p>Zhang Yi, chief analyst at market consultancy iiMedia Research, said, "The incident is basically an internal strife over making a balanced profit distribution between leading live­streamers and companies or MCN (multichannel network) agencies that manage livestreamers."</p>

<p>The East Buy case is not a stray incident, Zhang said, adding that many livestreaming e-commerce companies are star-oriented and rely hugely on a top livestreamer to attract customers and make profits, as can be seen from the emergence of Li Jiaqi, a top beauty and cosmetics livestreamer well-known as "lipstick king".</p>

<p>On Saturday night, Yu and Dong appeared in a livestream in order to prevent the incident's impact from further spilling over. Yu admitted that East Buy had been plunged into "chaos", and removing Sun from his current position was due to a series of mistakes he made while performing his management duties.</p>

<p>"Sun will continue to work in other positions in New Oriental," Yu said, emphasizing that Dong had never been asked to leave.</p>

<p>There were rumors in the market that Dong was being courted by other livestreaming e-commerce companies and some tech giants.</p>

<p>Recalling the past week, Dong said the dispute was "painful" and hoped it would end soon. He added that he was staying with East Buy.</p>

<h1>东方甄选风波，对直播行业有什么启发？</h1>

<h1>Livestreaming firms <B style="color:red">called on</B> to <B style="color:red">boost</B> <B style="color:red">governance</B></h1>

<h1>直播企业需加强治理</h1>

<P>East Buy, a <B style="color:red">subsidiary</B> of private <B style="color:red">tutoring</B> <B style="color:red">giant </B>New Oriental that successfully <B style="color:red">transitioned</B> to a live­streaming e-commerce company, <B style="color:#006600">removed</B> Sun Dongxu as its <B style="color:#CCCC00">executive</B> <B style="color:red">director</B> and CEO, and named New Oriental's founder Yu Minhong as its chief executive.</P>
<p>近日，成功转型直播电商的民企教辅巨头新东方旗下子公司东方甄选免去了孙东旭执行董事和CEO职务，由创始人董事长俞敏洪兼任东方甄选CEO。</p>

<p>The <B style="color:red">appointment</B>, which was confirmed by the Hong Kong Stock Exchange late on Sunday, came after a <B style="color:red">dispute</B> <B style="color:red">involving</B> the company's most influential livestreamer, Dong Yuhui, <B style="color:red">intensified</B> last week, leading the Hong Kong-listed company to suffer billion-yuan losses on the stock market within days.</P>

<p>周日（12月17日）晚，港交所确认了这一任命。此前，东方甄选最有影响力的主播董宇辉卷入了一场争论，事件在上周愈演愈烈，导致这家香港上市公司在几天之内在股市上遭受了数十亿元的损失。</p>

<p>The latest <B style="color:red">dispute</B> started after the editorial team of East Buy said on Dec 6 that the script used by Dong during livestreaming was written by the team and not by the star alone. It quickly <B style="color:red">prompted</B> a group of online shoppers and many of Dong's fans to question the company for taking <B style="color:red">credit</B> for his work and longtime efforts.</P>

<P>12月6日，东方甄选编辑团队表示，董宇辉在直播中使用的稿子是由团队撰写的，并非董宇辉独立创作，这一言论引发了争议，迅速引发了一批网购用户和董宇辉众多粉丝的质疑，认为东方甄选抢走了董宇辉的功劳，否认了他长期以来的努力。</P>

<p>On Tuesday, Sun Dongxu, then CEO of East Buy, said in a livestream that neither the editorial team nor Dong had behaved <B style="color:red">appropriately</B>, adding that Dong is treated well by the company and <B style="color:red">draws</B> a <B style="color:red">steep</B> <B style="color:red">annual</B> salary.</P>

<P>周二（12月12日），当时还是东方甄选CEO的孙东旭在一次直播中表示，编辑团队和董宇辉都存在不当行为，并称董宇辉在公司的待遇很好，年薪非常高。</P>

<P>Sun also <B style="color:red">condemned</B> the <B style="color:red">"fandom culture"</B>, noting that <B style="color:red">netizens</B> often attack a company because of their idol. He triggered a wave of anger among netizens with his remarks and <B style="color:red">aggressive</B> <B style="color:red">approach</B> during the livestream, including <B style="color:red">hurling</B> his cellphone onto a table.</P>

<P>孙东旭还谴责了“饭圈文化”，指出网民经常因为他们的偶像而攻击公司。他在直播中的言论和咄咄逼人的态度，包括将手机扔到桌子上的行为，引发了网民的愤怒。</p>

<P>Many netizens said they felt <B style="color:red">offended</B> by Sun's behavior. They said they felt like employees being <B style="color:red">rebuked</B> by their boss, instead of being respected as consumers.</P>

<P>许多网民认为孙东旭的行为非常冒犯，感觉自己就像被老板训斥的员工，而没有被作为消费者那样受到尊重。</P>

<P>Later, both Sun and Yu, the founder of New Oriental, as well as Dong, apologized for the incident and <B style="color:red">clarified</B> that the script used for the livestream was written by both the editorial team and Dong.</P>

<P>随后，孙东旭和新东方创始人俞敏洪以及董宇辉都为此事道歉，并澄清直播所用的稿子是由编辑团队和董宇辉共同撰写的。</P>

<p>However, this didn't stop the stock price of the Beijing-based company from <B style="color:red">plunging</B> to HK$26.25 ($3.69) per share on Friday from HK$32.75 on Dec 6. The number of followers on East Buy's Douyin account was 28 million as of Sunday, a <B style="color:red">significant</B> drop from over 31 million a week ago.</P>

<P>然而，这并没有阻止这家总部位于北京的公司股价从12月6日的每股32.75港元暴跌至周五的每股26.25港元（3.69美元）。截至周日，东方甄选的抖音账号粉丝已经下降到2800万，较一周前的3100多万大幅下降。</P>

<p>Zhang Yi, chief <B style="color:red">analyst</B> at market <B style="color:red">consultancy</B> iiMedia Research, said, "The incident is basically an internal <B style="color:red">strife</B> over making a balanced profit <B style="color:red">distribution</B> between leading live­streamers and companies or MCN (multichannel network) <B style="color:red">agencies</B> that manage livestreamers."</P>

市场咨询公司艾媒咨询的首席分析师张毅说：“此次事件可以解读为‘内讧’，也暴露出头部主播和管理主播的公司或MCN机构之间的利益分配问题。”

The East Buy case is not a <B style="color:red">stray</B> incident, Zhang said, adding that many livestreaming e-commerce companies are <B style="color:red">star-oriented</B> and <B style="color:red">rely</B> hugely on a top livestreamer to attract customers and make profits, as can be seen from the emergence of Li Jiaqi, a top beauty and <B style="color:red">cosmetics</B> livestreamer well-known as "<B style="color:red">lipstick</B> king".

张毅表示，东方甄选的这一事件并非孤立事件，很多直播电商公司都以明星主播为导向，非常依赖顶流主播来吸引用户和盈利，从被称为“口红一哥”的顶级美妆主播李佳琦就可以看出这一点。

On Saturday night, Yu and Dong appeared in a livestream in order to prevent the incident's impact from further <B style="color:red">spilling over</B>. Yu <B style="color:red">admitted</B> that East Buy had been plunged into "<B style="color:red">chaos</B>", and removing Sun from his current position was due to a series of mistakes he made while performing his management duties.

周六（12月16日）晚，为了防止事件影响进一步扩散，俞敏洪董宇辉现身直播间。俞敏洪承认东方甄选已经陷入了一个混乱的状态，解除孙东旭的职务是由于他在履行管理职责时犯下的一系列错误。

"Sun will continue to work in other positions in New Oriental," Yu said, <B style="color:red">emphasizing</B> that Dong had never been asked to leave.

“孙东旭将继续在新东方担任其他职务。”俞敏洪表示，并强调他们从来没有要赶走董宇辉。

There were <B style="color:red">rumors</B> in the market that Dong was being<B style="color:red">courted</B> by other livestreaming e-commerce companies and some tech <B style="color:red">giants</B>.

市场上有传言称，其他直播电商公司和一些科技巨头一直在向董宇辉抛出橄榄枝。

<B style="color:red">Recalling</B> the past week, Dong said the <B style="color:red">dispute</B> was "painful" and hoped it would end soon. He added that he was staying with East Buy.

回顾过去的一周，董宇辉表示这场纠纷“很痛苦”，希望能尽快结束，同时也表示他将继续留在东方甄选。
