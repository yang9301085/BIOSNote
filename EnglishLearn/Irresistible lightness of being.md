Lijiang is included in many bucket lists — for good reason.

The breathtaking landscapes and rich cultural heritage of Lijiang, in Yunnan province, continue to captivate tourists. In the first quarter of this year, the city received over 18.38 million visits, with its revenue from tourism reaching 26.8 billion yuan ($3.73 billion), according to the official figures.

"Tourism in Lijiang has revived, recovering to the post-pandemic level," says He Libin, head of the Lijiang culture and tourism bureau.

The World Tourism Alliance, a global nongovernmental and nonprofit organization established in China, recently held its members' day in Lijiang.

Keynote speakers delivered speeches about how to explore diversified models of rural vitalization through tourism and shared experiences of typical cases, including Lijiang.

"Rural tourism has become an important way to consolidate and extend the achievements of poverty alleviation," says He, who attended the event.

He believes that Lijiang has consistently attracted a large number of visitors over the years due to the appeal of its natural landscape and the vibrancy of its ethnic culture.

The old town of Lijiang was included on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1997 as a "historic townscape of high quality and authenticity".

In 2003, the Three Parallel Rivers of Yunnan Protected Areas, that traverse Lijiang, were added to the list. This protected area spans the upper reaches of three rivers — the Jinsha, Nujiang and Lancang.

The city's introduction of new tourism products rooted in local culture has contributed to its appeal.

According to He, various efforts have been made to enhance rural tourism in Lijiang, including the establishment of demonstration villages and towns to serve as role models, making forward-looking plans to preserve the ecology and cultivated land while promoting tourism, attracting capable nongovernmental investment and using innovative methods to implement tourism initiatives.

Among the demonstration villages is picturesque Yuhu village, home to the Naxi ethnic group.

Austrian-American botanist and explorer Joseph Rock, who once lived in the village, among other places in the region between 1922 and 1949, introduced Naxi culture and local plants to the Western world.

The Naxi developed Dongba Script, and in 2003, UNESCO added the Naxi Dongba literature manuscripts to its Memory of the World Register. These ritual texts are a record of the indigenous religion of the Naxi people and are among the few surviving ancient indigenous religious books written with pictographic script.
