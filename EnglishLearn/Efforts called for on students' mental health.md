如何加强学生心理健康教育？



Systemic pressures around education leading to negative outcomes for nation's youth

A recent high-profile case concerning three middle school boys who allegedly killed a classmate has sparked discussions on the mental health of left-behind children in China. A seventh-grade student surnamed Wang in Handan, Hebei province, was killed on March 10, and the suspects were taken into custody the next day, according to an official statement. It is alleged that the suspects, who went to the same school and are all under 14 years old, had bullied the victim for a long time. Media reports said they are children of migrant workers.

Zong Chunshan, director of the Beijing Youth Legal and Psychological Counseling Service Center, said left-behind children lack proper family education during critical stages of their development, which may result in psychological issues and behavioral deviations.

On March 18, the National Advisory Committee for Students' Mental Health advocated the promotion of greater awareness concerning the physical and mental health of children and adolescents. The foundation of students' mental health lies in the family, with a focus on the school and support from society, the committee said in a notice released by the Ministry of Education.

A rural children's mental health survey conducted in 2021 by professor Chen Zhiyan and her team from the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Institute of Psychology, showed that the detection rate of depression among children was only 25.2 percent. However, some parents still have a limited understanding of depression and have strong feelings of shame. Others may only focus on their children's behavioral manifestations without considering the underlying emotional and psychological factors. They may simplify the issue as a lack of interest in studying, adolescent rebellion or weak willpower.

Xu Ling, a political adviser and the vice-president of Guangdong Polytechnic Normal University, said she has found that collaboration among families, schools and society in tackling mental health issues of adolescents has failed to form a unified force. Xu said schools prioritize exam-oriented education and talent cultivation over extracurricular activities. Insufficient physical activities and labor education have led students to easily fall into the trap of "self-isolation, loneliness, anxiety and depression".

Many parents have excessive requirements for their children's academic achievements, with a focus on quick success, leading to conflicts between parents and children that have even escalated into suicidal incidents, she added. Because of the lack of professional personnel and resources, mental health services provided by grassroots institutions need to be improved urgently, she said. Cultural products such as online games, movies and animations that are filled with violence and vulgarity may also contribute to criminal behavior or self-harm, she added.

Political adviser Ding Zuohong said the threshold for the psychological counseling industry in China is relatively low, and many child psychologists lack professional qualifications. Ding proposed strengthening frustration education in schools, teaching young students how to effectively manage negative emotions.
