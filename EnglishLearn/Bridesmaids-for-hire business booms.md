The practice of hiring <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">bridesmaids</mark> for weddings is becoming increasingly popular, as more people recognize it offers a solution to the <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">dilemma</mark> of finding suitable <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">attendants</mark> for brides away from home while <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">eliminating</mark> the <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">awkwardness</mark> of social <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">indebtedness</mark>.

Professional bridesmaids offer their services on various online platforms, including social media apps. The bridesmaids advertise their reliability, <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">attentiveness</mark> and the high level of <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">coordination</mark> they can offer on the wedding day.

The market for hiring bridesmaids is <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">substantial</mark>. Statistics from goofish.com, a secondhand goods platform, said the <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">demand</mark> for hired bridesmaids during the May Day holiday in 2021 was more than 20 times higher than during the <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">corresponding</mark> period two years earlier. The demand for hired groomsmen was 25 percent of that for hired bridesmaids.

A large wedding usually requires six bridesmaids and six <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">groomsmen</mark>, while smaller weddings may have one to three of each. The fees for hiring bridesmaids vary, with top-tier bridesmaids charging 300 yuan ($42) to 1,000 yuan a wedding.

Hao Rongli, a 19-year-old nursing intern from a college in Qingdao, Shandong province, has <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">ventured</mark> into the bridesmaid-for-hire business as a part-time job. She has more than 300 bridesmaids available for hire and has bookings for months ahead.

Hao said there are several reasons the market will continue to <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">flourish</mark>. One is that when a bride <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">relocates</mark> to a different city to <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">pursue</mark> her career and the wedding <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">ceremony</mark> is held in the bridegroom's hometown, she may not have a close circle of friends there. Hiring professional bridesmaids allows her to <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">avoid</mark> having to invite distant relatives or <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">acquaintances</mark>. "By paying for the service, the bride avoids any potential discomfort in asking people she isn't close to for assistance or feeling socially indebted to friends or family who come from a long way away," Hao said.

The wedding process and related rules can sometimes be complex enough to make bridesmaids — close friends or not — tired and <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">irritated</mark>. Some have even posted their <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">complaints</mark> about <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">unpleasant</mark> experiences on social media platforms.

One bridesmaid recently shared her <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">dissatisfaction</mark> with her role at a wedding, where she felt unappreciated and overworked. The woman, who had taken two days off from work to <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">fulfill</mark> her duties, arrived at the wedding venue at 10 pm. Upon her arrival, she was immediately tasked with <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">decorating</mark> the room, without being offered any assistance or even a glass of water. She expressed her frustration, saying that being a bridesmaid required quick thinking and flexibility. "But am I an employee? Do not take it for <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">granted</mark>," she said.

Another woman advised against agreeing to be a bridesmaid for a co-worker one is not close to. In her particular case, she had only agreed to take on the role because the bride was <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">desperately</mark> in need of help due to her advanced age. However, her efforts went <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">unrewarded</mark>, as she did not receive a bridesmaid gift or red packet containing lucky money. The meals provided during the wedding were takeout for lunch and <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">leftovers</mark> for dinner.

Another bridesmaid emphasized that such roles should only be accepted if they assisted close friends, the only ones who could make the experience worthwhile. She said that as long as the bride is happy and <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">joyful</mark> on her wedding day, other <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">inconveniences</mark> can be overlooked, but those with average relationships would find it difficult to <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">refrain</mark> from <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">dwelling</mark> on trivial matters.




婚礼上的伴娘可能是租的？“职业伴娘”火了

“职业伴娘”，火速蹿红

婚礼上“租伴娘”的做法正变得越来越流行，因为越来越多的人发现，这种做法既能解决新娘在外地找不到合适伴娘的难题，又没有欠下人情的尴尬。

专业伴娘们在社交媒体等网络平台上运营自己的业务。她们宣传自己的可靠、周到，以及婚礼当天高超的协调能力。

租伴娘的市场非常可观。二手商品平台闲鱼的统计数据显示，2021年五一假期期间，租伴娘的需求量较两年前的同期增长了20多倍，而租伴郎的需求量则是伴娘的25%。

一场大型婚礼一般需要六个伴郎，六个伴娘，而规模小一些的婚礼上，伴郎伴娘大概也各有1-3个。租伴娘的费用各不相同，顶级伴娘每场婚礼收费300元（42美元）到1000元不等。

19岁的郝荣丽（音译）是山东青岛一所高校护理专业的实习生，职业伴娘是她的副业。她手下有300多位伴娘，而且接下来的几个月都有订单。

她认为这个市场将继续蓬勃发展，主要有几个原因。首先，如果新娘搬到另一个城市发展事业，而婚礼在新郎的家乡举行，她在当地可能没有什么亲密的朋友。租伴娘的话她就不必去遥远的家乡找亲戚或朋友来当伴娘。她说：“通过这项付费服务，新娘就不必去找那些不熟的朋友导致尴尬，也避免了让朋友或家人大老远赶来产生的亏欠感。”

婚礼流程和规则有时会很复杂，足以让伴娘（无论是熟或者不熟的朋友）感到疲惫和烦躁。有些人甚至在社交媒体平台上发帖抱怨（当伴娘）不愉快的经历。

一位伴娘最近就分享了她对自己对在婚礼上当伴娘的不满，她觉得自己干了很多活，却没有得到感激。为了当这个伴娘，她请了两天假，晚上10点才到达婚礼现场。人一到就被安排布置婚房，也没有人帮她，甚至连一杯水都没有。她表达了自己的不满，说当伴娘需要脑子快、人灵活。“但我是在打工吗？”她说：“请不要把这当成是理所当然的。”

另一位女生建议大家不要去帮不熟的同事做伴娘。她那次之所以同意去当伴娘，是因为新娘年纪有点大，急需帮忙。然而，她的努力没有得到任何回报，没有收到伴娘的伴手礼也没有红包。婚礼期间，中午吃的是外卖，晚上吃的则是剩饭剩菜。

还有一位伴娘强调说，只有闺蜜才会去帮这种忙当伴娘，因为只有这样才能让这段经历变得有价值。她说，只要新娘在婚礼当天是幸福快乐的，其他的不便都可以不计较，但关系一般的朋友就很难不计较这些琐事。
