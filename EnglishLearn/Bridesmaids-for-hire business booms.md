The practice of hiring brid<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;"></mark>esmaids for weddings is becoming increasingly popular, as more people recognize it offers a solution to the dilemma of finding suitable attendants for brides away from home while eliminating the awkwardness of social indebtedness.

Professional bridesmaids offer their services on various online platforms, including social media apps. The bridesmaids advertise their reliability, attentiveness and the high level of coordination they can offer on the wedding day.

The market for hiring bridesmaids is substantial. Statistics from goofish.com, a secondhand goods platform, said the demand for hired bridesmaids during the May Day holiday in 2021 was more than 20 times higher than during the corresponding period two years earlier. The demand for hired groomsmen was 25 percent of that for hired bridesmaids.

A large wedding usually requires six bridesmaids and six groomsmen, while smaller weddings may have one to three of each. The fees for hiring bridesmaids vary, with top-tier bridesmaids charging 300 yuan ($42) to 1,000 yuan a wedding.

Hao Rongli, a 19-year-old nursing intern from a college in Qingdao, Shandong province, has ventured into the bridesmaid-for-hire business as a part-time job. She has more than 300 bridesmaids available for hire and has bookings for months ahead.

Hao said there are several reasons the market will continue to flourish. One is that when a bride relocates to a different city to pursue her career and the wedding ceremony is held in the bridegroom's hometown, she may not have a close circle of friends there. Hiring professional bridesmaids allows her to avoid having to invite distant relatives or acquaintances. "By paying for the service, the bride avoids any potential discomfort in asking people she isn't close to for assistance or feeling socially indebted to friends or family who come from a long way away," Hao said.

The wedding process and related rules can sometimes be complex enough to make bridesmaids — close friends or not — tired and irritated. Some have even posted their complaints about unpleasant experiences on social media platforms.

One bridesmaid recently shared her dissatisfaction with her role at a wedding, where she felt unappreciated and overworked. The woman, who had taken two days off from work to fulfill her duties, arrived at the wedding venue at 10 pm. Upon her arrival, she was immediately tasked with decorating the room, without being offered any assistance or even a glass of water. She expressed her frustration, saying that being a bridesmaid required quick thinking and flexibility. "But am I an employee? Do not take it for granted," she said.

Another woman advised against agreeing to be a bridesmaid for a co-worker one is not close to. In her particular case, she had only agreed to take on the role because the bride was desperately in need of help due to her advanced age. However, her efforts went unrewarded, as she did not receive a bridesmaid gift or red packet containing lucky money. The meals provided during the wedding were takeout for lunch and leftovers for dinner.

Another bridesmaid emphasized that such roles should only be accepted if they assisted close friends, the only ones who could make the experience worthwhile. She said that as long as the bride is happy and joyful on her wedding day, other inconveniences can be overlooked, but those with average relationships would find it difficult to refrain from dwelling on trivial matters.
